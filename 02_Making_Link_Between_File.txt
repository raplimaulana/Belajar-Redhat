##All hard links that reference the same file will have the same link count, access permissions, user and group ownerships, time stamps, and file content. 
##If any of that information is changed using one hard link, all other hard links pointing to the same file will show the new information as well. 
##This is because each hard link points to the same data on the storage device.
##Even if the original file gets deleted, the contents of the file are still available as long as at least one hard link exists. 
##Data is only deleted from storage when the last hard link is deleted.

### Hard Link ###
1. Hard links can only be used with regular files. You cannot use ln to create a hard link to a directory or special file. 
2. Hard links can only be used if both files are on the same file system. The file-system hierarchy can be made up of multiple storage devices. 
   Depending on the configuration of your system, when you change into a new directory, that directory and its contents may be stored on a different file system. 

ln newfile.txt /tmp/newfile-hlink2.txt






### Soft Link ###
1. They can link two files on different file systems. 
2. They can point to a directory or special file, not just a regular file.
3. When the original regular file gets deleted, the soft link will still point to the file but the target is gone. 
   A soft link pointing to a missing file is called a "dangling soft link."

ln -s /home/user/newfile-link2.txt /tmp/newfile-symlink.txt

##Check file link
ls -l newfile-link2.txt /tmp/newfile-symlink.txt
