### User ###
There are three main types of user account: the superuser, system users, and regular users.
1. The superuser account is for administration of the system. The name of the superuser is root and the account has UID 0. 
   The superuser has full access to the system.
2. The system has system user accounts which are used by processes that provide supporting services. 
   These processes, or daemons, usually do not need to run as the superuser. 
   They are assiged non-privileged accounts that allow them to secure their files and other resources from each other and from regular users on the system. 
3. Most users have regular user accounts which they use for their day-to-day work.

*user01 = Username for this user 
 x      = The user's password used to be stored here in encrypted format. 
           That has been moved to the /etc/shadow file, which will be covered later. This field should always be x.
 1000   = The UID number for this user account. 
 1000   = The GID number for this user account's primary group. 
 Rapli  = The real name for this user. 
 /home/user01 = The home directory for this user. 
 /bin/bash    = 7.	The default shell program for this user, which runs on login. 






### Group ###
A group is a collection of users that need to share access to files and other system resources.
Groups can be used to grant access to files to a set of users instead of just a single user.

*group01                = Group name for this group 
 x                      = Obsolete group password field. This field should always be x.
 10000                  = The GID number for this group 
 user01, user02, user03 = A list of users who are members of this group as a supplementary group.

##Primary Groups and Supplementary Groups
Every user has exactly one primary group. By default, this is the group that will own new files created by the user.
Normally, when you create a new regular user, a new group with the same name as that user is created. 
That group is used as the primary group for the new user, and that user is the only member of this User Private Group. 
It turns out that this helps make management of file permissions simpler,

Users may also have supplementary groups. Membership in supplementary groups is determined by the /etc/group file. 
Users are granted access to files based on whether any of their groups have access.
