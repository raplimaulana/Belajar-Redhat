##Running command with sudo
#sudo is configured to allow the user01 user to run the command usermod as root
sudo usermod -L user02
*contoh perintah lock account yang biasanya hanya bisa dilakukan oleh root

#If there is a nonadministrative user account on the system that can use sudo to run the su command
#The sudo su - command sets up the root environment exactly like a normal login because the su - command ignores the settings made by sudo and sets up >the environment from scratch.
sudo su -

#Another way to access the root account with sudo is to use the sudo -i command. 
#The default configuration of the sudo -i command actually sets up some details of the root user's environment differently than a normal login. 
#For example, it sets the PATH environment variable slightly differently. This affects where the shell will look to find commands.
sudo -i






### Configuring Sudo ###
The main configuration file for sudo is /etc/sudoers. By default, /etc/sudoers also includes the contents of any files in the /etc/sudoers.d
%wheel      ALL=(ALL)       ALL

*%wheel    = the user or group to whom the rule applies.
 ALL=(ALL) = specifies that on any host that might have this file, wheel can run any command. 
 ALL       = specifies that wheel can run those commands as any user on the system.
