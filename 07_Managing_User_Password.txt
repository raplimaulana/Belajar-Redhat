##At one time, encrypted passwords were stored in the world-readable /etc/passwd file. This was thought to be reasonably secure until dictionary attacks on encrypted passwords became common. 
##At that point, the encrypted passwords were moved to a separate /etc/shadow file which is readable only by root. 

user01:$6$CSsX...output omitted...:17933:0:99999:7:2:18113:
*user    = username of the account this password belongs to.
 $6$CSsX = The encrypted password of the user.
 17933   = The day on which the password was last changed. This is set in days since 1970-01-01, and is calculated in the UTC time zone.
 0       = The minimum number of days that have to elapse since the last password change before the user can change it again.
 99999   = The maximum number of days that can pass without a password change before the password expires. An empty field means it does not expire based on time since the last change.
 7       = Warning period. The user will be warned about an expiring password when they login for this number of days before the deadline.
 2       = Inactivity period. Once the password has expired, it will still be accepted for login for this many days. After this period has elapsed, the account will be locked.
 18113   = The day on which the password expires. This is set in days since 1970-01-01, and is calculated in the UTC time zone. An empty field means it does not expire on a particular date.
:        = The last field is usually empty and is reserved for future use.
