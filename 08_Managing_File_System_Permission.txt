##shows detailed information about permissions and ownership
ls -l file
ls -ld /home         #specific
ls -la               #show hidden file

drwx-wxr--. 2 database1 consultant1 4096 Apr 4 10:23 .

d   = directory
rwx = user that own file
-wx = the group that own file
r-- = all other user

.   = directory itself
..  = parent directory


##changing file and diretory permissions
chmod go=rw folder1
chmod a+x folder2

•	Who is u, g, o, a (for user, group, other, all)
•	What is +, -, = (for add, remove, set exactly)
•	Which is r, w, x (for read, write, execute)

chmod 750 folder1
chmod 644 folder2

•	Start with 0.
•	If the read permission should be present for this access level, add 4.
•	If the write permission should be present, add 2.
•	If the execute permission should be present, add 1.

Examine the permissions -rwxr-x---. 
For the user, rwx is calculated as 4+2+1=7 
For the group, r-x is calculated as 4+0+1=5
for other users, --- is represented with 0. 
Putting these three together, the numeric representation of those permissions is 750.

The chmod command supports the "-R" option to recursively set permissions on the files in an entire directory tree.
When using the "-R" option, it can be useful to set permissions symbolically using the "X" option. 
This allows the execute (search) permission to be set on directories so that their contents can be accessed, without changing permissions on most files.

##changing file and directory user or group ownership
#change user owner
chown student folder1
chown -R student folder1

#change group owner
chown :admin folder1

#change user and group owner at the same time
chown student:admin folder1
