##Installing and removing groups of software with yum
yum also has the concept of groups, which are collections of related software installed together for a particular purpose. 
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, there are two kinds of groups. Regular groups are collections of packages. Environment groups are collections of regular groups. 
The packages or groups provided by a group may be mandatory (they must be installed if the group is installed), default (normally installed if the group is installed), or optional (not installed when the group is installed, unless specifically requested).
