/var/log/messages | Most syslog messages are logged here.                               |
                  | Except message related to authentication and email processing,      |
                  | schedule job execution and those which are purely debugging-relate. |

/var/log/secure   | Syslog message related to security and authentication events.       |

/var/log/maillog  | Syslog message related to the mail server.                          |

*Some applications do not use syslog to manage their log messages, although typically, they do place their log files in a subdirectory of /var/log. 
 For example, the Apache Web Server saves log messages to files in a subddirectory of the /var/log directory.

##rsyslog
Many programs use the syslog protocol to log events to the system. 
Each log message is categorized by a facility (the type of message) and a priority (the severity of the message). 

The rsyslog service uses the facility and priority of log messages to determine how to handle them. 
This is configured by rules in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and any file in the /etc/rsyslog.d directory that has a file name extension of .conf. 
Software packages can easily add rules by installing an appropriate file in the /etc/rsyslog.d directory.

the following table lists the standard eight rsyslog priorities from highest to lowest
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 CODE | PRIORITY |            Severity              |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 0    | emerg    | System is unusable               |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 1    | alert    | Action must be taken immediately |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 2    | crit     | Critical condition               |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 3    | err      | Non-critical error condition     |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 4    | warning  | Warning condition                |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 5    | notice   | Normal but significant event     |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 6    | info     | Informational event              |
------|----------|----------------------------------|
 7    | debug    | Debugging-level message          |
------|----------|----------------------------------|


##LOG FILE ROTATION
The logrotate tool rotates log files to keep them from taking up too much space in the file system containing the /var/log directory. 
When a log file is rotated, it is renamed with an extension indicating the date it was rotated. 
For example, the old /var/log/messages file may become /var/log/messages-20190130 if it is rotated on 2019-01-30
After a certain number of rotations, typically after four weeks, the oldest log file is discarded to free disk space.

Log messages start with the oldest message on top and the newest message at the end of the log file. 
The rsyslog service uses a standard format while recording entries in log files. 

Feb 11 20:11:48 localhost sshd[1433]: Failed password for student from 172.25.0.10 port 59344 ssh2

*Feb 11 20:11:48                = the time stamp when the log entry was recorded
 localhost                      = the host from which the log message was sent 
 sshd[1433]                     = the program or process name and PID number that sent the log message
 Failed password for student... = the actual message sent

##monitoring logs
tail -f /var/log/secure                      #tail -f = menampilkan 10 baris terakhir

##sending syslog manualy
##example create the /etc/rsyslog.d/debug.conf file with the necessary entries to redirect all log messages having the debug priority to /var/log/messages-debug

#create file
vim /etc/rsyslog.d/debug.conf 
*.debug /var/log/message-debug

#restart rsyslog service
systemctl restart rsyslog

#Verify that all the log messages with the debug priority appears in the /var/log/messages-debug file
#generate a log message with the user facility and the debug priority
logger -p user.debug "Debug Message Test"

#view the last ten log messages from the /var/log/messages-debug file
tail /var/log/messages-debug
