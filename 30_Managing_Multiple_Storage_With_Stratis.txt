### STRATIS ###
Stratis runs as a service that manages pools of physical storage devices, and transparently creates and manages volumes for the file systems being created.

In a volume-managed file system, file systems are built inside shared pools of disk devices using a concept known as thin provisioning. 
Stratis file systems do not have fixed sizes and no longer preallocate unused block space. 
Although the file system is still built on a hidden LVM volume, Stratis manages the underlying volume for you and can expand it when needed. 
The in-use size of a file system is seen as the amount of actual blocks in use by contained files. 
The space available to a file system is the amount of space still unused in the pooled devices on which it resides. 
Multiple file systems can reside in the same pool of disk devices, sharing the available space, but file systems can also reserve pool space to guarantee availability when needed.

Stratis uses stored metadata to recognize managed pools, volumes, and file systems. They should only be managed using Stratis tools and commands.
Manually configuring Stratis file systems could cause the loss of that metadata and prevent Stratis from recognizing the file systems it has created.

You can create multiple pools with different sets of block devices. From each pool, you can create one or more file systems. 
Currently, you can create up to 2 24 file systems per pool.

##install Stratis
yum install stratis-cli stratisid

##activate stratisd service
systemctl enable --now stratisid 

##create pools of one or more block devices 
stratis pool create pool1 /dev/vdb

*each pool is a subdirectory under the /stratis directory

##view the list of available pools
stratis pool list

##view the block devices of a pool
stratis blockdev list pool1

##add additional block devices to a pool
stratis pool add-data pool1 /dev/vdc

##create a dynamic and flexible file system from a pool
stratis filesystem create pool1 filesystem1

*the links to the Stratis file systems are in the /stratis/pool1 directory

##stratis supports file-system snapshotting with the stratis filesystem snapshot command 
##snapshots are independent of the source file systems
stratis filesystem snapshot pool1 filesystem1 snapshot1

##view the list of available file systems
stratis filesytem list

##persistently mount a Stratis file system
lsblk --output=UUID /stratis/pool1/filesystem1
UUID=31b9...8c55 /dir1 xfs defaults,x-systemd.requires=stratisd.service 0 0

*x-systemd.requires=stratisd.service = mount option delays mounting the file system until after systemd starts the stratisd.service during the boot process
