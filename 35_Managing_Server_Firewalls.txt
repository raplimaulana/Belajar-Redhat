### FIREWALL ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS ###
The Linux kernel includes netfilter, a framework for network traffic operations such as packet filtering, network address translation and port translation. 
By implementing handlers in the kernel that intercept function calls and messages, netfilter allows other kernel modules to interface directly with the kernel's networking stack. 

Firewall software uses these hooks to register filter rules and packet-modifying functions, allowing every packet going through the network stack to be processed. 
Any incoming, outgoing, or forwarded network packet can be inspected, modified, dropped, or routed programmatically before reaching user space components or applications. 
Netfilter is the primary component in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 firewalls.


##nftables enhances netfilter
The Linux kernel also includes nftables, a new filter and packet classification subsystem that has enhanced portions of netfilter's code, but retaining the netfilter architecture such as networking stack hooks, connection tracking system, and the logging facility. 
The advantages of the nftables update is faster packet processing, faster ruleset updates, and simultaneous IPv4 and IPv6 processing from the same rules. 
Netfilter is configured through multiple utility frameworks, including iptables, ip6tables, arptables, and ebtables, which are now deprecated. 
Nftables uses the single nft user-space utility, allowing all protocol management to occur through a single interface, eliminating historical contention caused by diverse front ends and multiple netfilter interfaces.


##introducing firewalld
Firewalld is a dynamic firewall manager, a front end to the nftables framework using the nft command. 
Until the introduction of nftables, firewalld used the iptables command to configure netfilter directly, as an improved alternative to the iptables service. 

With firewalld, firewall management is simplified by classifying all network traffic into zones. Based on criteria such as the source IP address of a packet or the incoming network interface, traffic is diverted into the firewall rules for the appropriate zone. 
Each zone has its own list of ports and services that are either open or closed.

The zones are customized with rules appropriate for particular connections. This is especially useful when traveling between home, work, and public wireless networks. 
A user might want their system's sshd service to be reachable when connected to their home and corporate networks, but not when connected to the public wireless network in the local coffee shop.

*For laptops or other machines that regularly change networks, NetworkManager can be used to automatically set the firewall zone for a connection.

Firewalld checks the source address for every packet coming into the system. 
If that source address is assigned to a specific zone, the rules for that zone apply. 
If the source address is not assigned to a zone, firewalld associates the packet with the zone for the incoming network interface and the rules for that zone apply. 
If the network interface is not associated with a zone for some reason, then firewalld associates the packet with the default zone.
The default zone is not a separate zone, but is a designation for an existing zone. Initially, firewalld designates the public zone as default, and maps the lo loopback interface to the trusted zone.

Most zones allow traffic through the firewall, which matches a list of particular ports and protocols, such as 631/udp, or pre-defined services, such as ssh. 
If the traffic does not match a permitted port and protocol or service, it is generally rejected. (The trusted zone, which permits all traffic by default, is one exception to this.)


##pre-defined zones
Firewalld has pre-defined zones, each of which you can customize. By default, all zones permit any incoming traffic which is part of a communication initiated by the system, and all outgoing traffic. 
The following table details these initial zone configuration.

##pre-defined services
Firewalld has a number of pre-defined services. 
These service definitions help you identify particular network services to configure. 
Instead of having to research relevant ports for the samba-client service, for example, specify the pre-built samba-client service to configure the correct ports and protocols. 
The following table lists the pre-defined services used in the initial firewall zones configuration.

System administrators interact with firewalld in three ways:
•	Directly edit configuration files in /etc/firewalld/ (not discussed in this chapter)

•	The firewall-cmd command-line tool
    #The example commands below set the default zone to dmz, assign all traffic coming from the 192.168.0.0/24 network to the internal zone, and open the network ports for the mysql service on the internal zone.
    firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=dmz
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-source=192.168.0.0/24
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=mysql
    firewall-cmd -reload

    *Note that unless otherwise specified, almost all commands will work on the runtime configuration, unless the --permanent option is specified. 
     If the --permanent option is specified, you must activate the setting by also running the firewall-cmd --reload command, which reads the current permanent configuration and applies it as the new runtime configuration. 
    *Many of the commands listed take the --zone=ZONE option to determine which zone they affect. Where a netmask is required, use CIDR notation, such as 192.168.1/24.

•	The Web Console graphical interface
    1.	log in with privileged access by clicking the Reuse my password for privileged tasks option. This permits the user to execute commands with sudo privileges to modify firewall services.
    2.	Click the Networking option in the left navigation menu to display the Firewall section in the main networking page. 
        Click the Firewall link to access the allowed services list.
    3.	The allowed services listed are those that are currently permitted by the firewall. Click the arrow (>) to the left of the service name to view service details. 
        To add a service, click the Add Services... button in the upper right corner of the Firewall Allowed Services page.
    4.	The Add Services page displays the available pre-defined services.
    5.	To select a service, scroll through the list or enter a selection in the Filter Services text box. 
        In the following example, the string http is entered into the search text box to find services containing that string; that is, web related services. 
        Select the check box to the left of the services to allow through the firewall. 
        Click the Add Services button to complete the process.
    6.	The interface returns to the Firewall Allowed Services page, where you can review the updated allowed services list.
